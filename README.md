## About me 👋
Hi, my name is Hanin.

I have been working as a Software Tester for the past three years, gaining experience in both manual and automation testing. Testing has become more than just a job for me—it’s a field where I can continuously learn, improve, and contribute to creating high-quality software.

My background includes working with Cypress for automation testing, as well as JavaScript, Angular, and e-commerce platforms. I enjoy diving into complex applications, ensuring seamless user experiences, and collaborating with teams to deliver the best possible product.

In this portfolio, I share my journey in QA, my knowledge, and the practical skills I’ve developed through hands-on experience. I am constantly working on expanding my expertise, particularly in test automation, as I strive to enhance both efficiency and test coverage.

I’m excited to continue growing in this field and making a meaningful impact in software quality
